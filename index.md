### A Collection of Writings :)
#### A Sermon:
My podium is tall, brown, and carries within it a sense of venerability that only the most deceitful can dream of. My imp like legs find it difficult to balance on the stilts they stand on, yet with my limp I arrive squarely at my destination—the head of the assembly. I draw a piece of paper folded crisply in half from my coat pocket. The bodies of the assembly were paused, but I felt their souls dancing across the room in anticipation of my groundbreaking words. I start with a wisecrack about Jesus or something and glance at the clock, my brain hears the ticks which my ears cannot. My heart pants as if it has just run a marathon and a tsunami hits my forehead. My legs push off my tall stilts and my hands thrust the black suit glued to my body into the assembly. I am bare in front of my onlookers. I am bare and I am not proud. A woman in the crowd suddenly resumes her movement. She gazes up, the full sight of her pretty curls obstructed by the straw sun hat she chose to adorn her head with. Her straw hat that so evidently was out of place for her gloved hands sat neatly one atop the other, her thin legs crossed each other creating the perfect “X.” Her feet were outfitted with heels bedazzled with pearls. Her hot pink dress fiercely grasped her tiny waist and thick curves. Her nose was tiny. Her nose was tiny. But her straw hat looked as if it had been plucked off the top of a homeless person’s head. It seemed like an illusion, waiting to dissipate into space. Questions. Questions fluttered through my mind like butterflies who had found an open field. Questions like who was this straw hatted woman and why did she gaze up? Questions like who on earth would wear such a vile straw hat? My patience was wearing thin. Thinner yet. My eyes shut and then my eyelids slowly elevate. I see the woman’s eyes now. Black. Questions like. Questions like how long could I contain myself before I lunged? Questions like how long would it take for me to carve this woman’s face into a trophy? Questions how they swarm. Questions like. Questions like. Questions like. Questions like. 
#### The Lady:
With every step I take I seem to drain the ground of any light it possibly could receive. Everywhere I set my foot turns to resemble a dimly lit alleyway, garbage littered about, the walls constricting my view of the outside. I know I am alone, yet I always make sure to look over my shoulder, not because I’m afraid of someone delivering a fatal blow from behind, but because I am afraid of the consequences of my own subterfuge. A woman walks past me. Bony, with a bright pink blouse and matching hot pink wedges. Her hair done neatly in a bun and her skin pale as the walls of a kindergarten class. She wore a white cardigan bestrewn in holes, but her black jeans had none of that. Her lustrous pearl earrings jangled as she approached me. She was simply gorgeous– with every step she took the ground became infused with more and more and more-light. She returned the soul to the ground around me, and the tiles of my alleyway sporadically flipped to reveal that I had been standing in Eden all along. Before me, a bright orange rose unfolded its petals revealing long streaks of green and tiny yellow seeds. One petal drooped all the way to my feet, beckoning me to enter its kingdom of pollen. Swifty I raised my right hand and returned the depressed petal to its rightful position. I diverted my gaze downward to see the flare of pink sparkling from my feet and my crooked mouth corners molded upwards. 
#### Floral Suburbia:
I pass a field of flowers on my way home from school every day. At the intersection of two vacant long streets of suburban American hell there is a meadow with flowers so grand they sparkle as if bathed in glitter and pixie dust. On my way home from school sometimes I will sto and watch the morning dew glisten atop the soft flower beds. I am meticulous in my attention to detail for I am on a quest - I am in search of a very special flower - one which I may pluck. I do not condone the death of more flowers than necessary. I must say now that I am many things - but wasteful is not one. But dear reader, you must understand - this flower is the one. It is the one I must grip before going to bed at night, the one whose glance makes everything all right. I had seen my special flower once, she was brown and wilted at the time - mourning the loss of her beauty no doubt. As the skies changed color and the leaves turned over I came across the infamous one again. She had changed tenfold by then - only recognizable to the eye of an especially skilled floral critic.  Its stem was vibrant green, its leaves unfurling in the sprung spring. Overcoming the harsh autumn browns, the flower was bright with orange hues to head bestrewn in passive hints of yellow. My breathtaking love died the following spring for she could not bear the ill comprehension of her own beauty. Now, I have an image of a flower in my mind, one graced with gifts from heaven after put through trials of hell. This flower will be the prettiest flower ever sprung in this spring time. 
#### True Stories:
Opposite from my brother, I sat on a curved bright red bench, my face plastered with makeup. On my right sat an Asian woman with pin straight black hair scrolling past various Chinese women eating savory dishes on the deathtrap of Instagram. Across from me sat a narcissistic wasian man who had a love affair with all things gray. My brother, busy shoving a banana down his throat as if it were a cock, did not notice the shadow gaining miles on the tabletop in front of him. My mascara’d eyes ticked upwards and I saw the shadow man for the first time. <br/> <br/>
A small cement alcove exists in the back of the tiny hellscape, overlooking a field planted with seeds of memories. I sit there now as I did once before. Many, many, many days ago I sat in this very spot while the rain poured, and I watched on as he sat in his blue jeans and purple shirt on the cement ledge, unfazed by the water his hair was soaking up. I sat safely in my hooded alcove for I did not want any runny mascara to send the man running - I asked him to tell me all about himself. Time became a farce as we spoke to one another, and from my chest emanated light creating a rainbow around his head. I was late to Spanish class that day, but I remember walking to my brother and telling him that I was ecstatic—I had finally found a friend. Now, I propel my lonely body off the lifeless cement floor. The only thing of note about this day is that it is sunny and it is cold. <br/> <br/>
On the second floor of the hot, burning red building there exists a room, nested secretly all the way in the back. Its floor is designed to extract heat from the body of whomever comes into contact with it, but the floor was our favorite place. In the light of the projector in this dark an empty room we sat and talked for hours. Here I told him all about me. Here, on the last day of May, we high fived and our hands remained a little too long. On the last day of June his hand slipped away. 
	On the last day of June the shadow monster tore off his disguise for he knew it was safe. The shadow monster was not very good at his job. He was a chameleon attracted to the next shiny, new thing. My only sin was that I was shiny and new for far too long. I look now and I wonder if a part of him died or if he was just acting all along. I look now and I can see clearly. I have physics work to do. 
#### The Chair Emporium off of 46:
There is a spacious chair emporium off of 46. <br /> 
From the outside it looks like a manor where ghosts go to rest. Its dark, damp interior is infested with pests. <br/> 
Climbing the hills in his Rav-4 with buttons galore, we narrowly missed crashing into its tall black doors or should I say eye sores. <br/> 
I stare at him with a shock soaked face, but his eyes all but fessed. <br/> 
He shoved the driver's side door open with the bone of his wrist without leaning over first to give me a kiss. <br/> 
I watched him leave the car, something inside him roaring aloud and as if he had seen something profound. His confidence abounds. <br/> 
Here, for the very first time I realized something was amiss. About this chair emporium off of 46. <br/> 
The tall black doors burst open and he starts to fret. <br/> 
I follow his wet trail of sweat. <br/> 
Inside the halls I roam until I hear the moan of Mr. Pail. That whose erection I never fail. <br/> 
My feet carry my motionless mind inside. Carry on carrion the chairs start to wail. <br/>
A bird is perched on a chair over there. She sings the song of the nightingale. <br/> 
As her ballad rings, I see him. Has he grown wings? <br/> 
He sits on a golden chair that is slowly folding causing a tear. His wings spring the chair into the air. <br/> 
I have a wish to leave this chair emporium off of 46, surely that is fair. <br/> 
Do you see my great might? He says. Do you see all these chairs? He says. <br/> 
That one spins and that one wins. That one is sought and that one is not. Do you know which chair is hot and which one rots? He says <br/> 
His cheap word games made my heart weep. <br/> 
How had he gone so deep? <br/> 
Into my skin his words seeped. <br/> 
He had sinned and I don’t know why we had come to this chair emporium off of 46. <br/> 
#### Pierre the Pauper:
Pierre, young man why does your left leg tremble with such interminable vibration. My my my, you naughty voracious youngster your right hand, are you shaking it? Would you believe me if I said no mama? Would you believe me if I said that I was shaking and trembling, and now convulsing on this hard concrete floor because I wanted to see the gleam of your eyes, that which I have not seen in eons. I am unsure mama. I am unsure if white foam pools in my mouth because I want a glance, a sigh, an indication of life from that nimble, delicate body of yours or if my limbs twist out of place because I want them to. I am unsure if I can stop myself mama. I am unsure if I can stop these strange contortions. I am willing for you mama, for your love mama, and I know that if I cannot stop this game of dystopian twister then I must submit the final neckly crack to myself. What kind of son would I be if I let tears extinguish the radiance of your pristine face, mama? 
#### Mr. Mailman:
My mother was engulfed in flames when I was six years old. Sometimes I will hold out my hand to touch her soft, round face but before my tiny fingers can grasp onto the cusp of her face, her body becomes consumed in heat. The dream of her is so tangible, it's so close. But every time my little arms extend to affirm that she is something more than a figment of my imagination, they’re ruthlessly burned by the scornful gods trying me for my sins. Out here, in the void of darkness, there is nothing for me to do but to picture her. Picture her on the beach, at the store picking tomatoes plucked from the best vineyards, on the phone being a coy sabeutoeer with one of the bitchy neighborhood mothers, carrying my brother the size of a grapefruit up the front steps. Vivid images of her infect my mind like a relieving cancer in this abyss of continuous night. I have grown tired of the color black saturating the canvas of my life. All my eyes can see an eternity of the color black. There is nothing about the color that bothers me. It does not fill me with fear any more than dying out in this cold hell does. In fact, it makes me feel absolutely nothing. I stare out in the expanse of black and my mind is mindlessly blank. The color black should be filled up in a syringe and injected into patients awaiting invasive surgery. Out in the cold, there is but one thing keeping my helmet on my head - anticipation. Dear reader, I am anticipating a victory. I am hopeful that the parcel of victory will be left on my front steps in the void. I hope Mr. Mailman can find his way. 
#### Green Goo:
Green goo constantly gushes through my brain. The goo is Poseidon’s mother, the dark expanse of my brain is a ground for her next glow-in-the-dark sea. She discovers the momentary satisfaction that I may feel and infects it with piercing shards of self doubt. She creates channels for desperation to soak into my neural tissue forcing me to chase and chase and chase as she rushes and rushes and rushes. What on earth is she looking for, if not fucking chaos? Streams of chaos with my mouth falling open emitting eerie green light, eyes follow suit, and body convulses. The goo trickles down slowly, pitter pattering on the inside of my skull like rain. It implants itself into my veins and slowly my arms become immovable, my legs untouchable, my stomach involuted, my fingers bent backwards, but my eyes look straight forward. They look forward, but far they cannot see for the goo splatters its juicy intestines across my line of sight. What caustic reaction can dissolve this great infecting goo? Which exterminator is to be called? 
#### Ms. Gupta:
Ms. Gupta I am writing to you today to determine if you are a small speck of dust, undeserving of a glance or if you are a bird waiting to spread her wings and leap. Ms. Gupta I am questioning your character. I am questioning if you are compassionate. I am questioning if you are clear. I am questioning if you are an opportunist. I am questioning if you are part of the dust or if you are diamond within it. Ms. Gupta I am writing to you today to determine if the fates exist. I am writing to you to determine if anything can be done. I am writing to you today to determine if the GOD the overlord is punishing you or if you are punishing yourself. Ms. Gupta I am writing to you today to determine what you believe about yourself. Ms. Gupta, Ms. Gupta, Ms. Gupta. Do you believe you are a sinner? Do you believe you have transgressed? Do you believe you are worthy of any rest? Ms. Gupta I am asking you these questions today because I believe in you - I believe in your beauty, I believe in your charm. I believe you are intelligent without measure and capable of infinite. I think that it's important that you start to believe in yourself again. Does there exist any eternal karma? Can any of this be changed? Or are you stuck in this stupid foray? All these thoughts, they plague your mind - they tell you “stop, do not unwind.” They say oh you misinformed maiden, you do not know how life works. You do know what people want - what people need. They say in the real world there are goblins under every bridge you cross and the goblins never refuse a good meal. They say this is how the world is and then they slowly creep back into their den, under the bridge. They say look Ms. Gupta! Look at the mighty mess you’ve made. You’ve made tsunamis erupt from those desert dry eyes of theirs, you’ve made the Earth crack open Ms. Gupta. You’ve made volcanoes erupt Ms. Gupta. You’ve spun the Earth out of control, you’ve killed all the roses, all the bison. But Ms. Gupta you’ve killed more than just that - you’ve killed their hearts. You’ve killed their hearts. Don’t you hate yourself Ms. Gupta. Do you not think it right to jump into the lava, the crack, the water. Do you not think it right to submerge and suffocate yourself? Do you not think it right Ms. Gupta? 

#### Alexei and Mountains:
“Ms. Gupta I wonder what has caused this great change. What has caused mountains to move from north to south? What has caused all these starts to lose their route?” <br/> <br/>
“What makes you think that no mountains remain Alexei? I see one right over there. It is small in stature and abrasive to touch, but it is a mountain nonetheless. Do you believe we’ve truly won until we have pushed that mountain as well?” <br/> <br/>
“I suppose not Ms. Gupta. Would you like to try your hand or should I?” <br/> <br/>
“I think a foot will suffice for this one Alexei, one swift kick as if it was a soccer ball to be punted from one tip of the rocky sphere to the other.” <br/> <br/>
“Well, it seems you might have your work cut out for you then Ms. Gupta” Alexei says motioning towards the expanse of tiny hills stretching miles. <br/> <br/>
“Well that riles you up doesn’t it Alexei?” 

### Critiques and Opinions 
#### High School: 
Real passion is the miniscule diamond in an expansive sea of zirconia. An undying love for a subject which one wishes to study is rare, but arguably imperative for sustained commitment. A reasonable assumption from here is that students who are fiercely passionate about a field of study should be given resources to excel and increase their utility for the greater good of society. Instead, students have found their passions stymied by the often authoritarian and oppressive structure of contemporary high school. Rules made to stifle the actions of the few are applied to the masses without a care or a second thought. High school, in many instances, has become somewhat of an intellectually boring prison for students who have a clear and set path in life. With its onslaught of arbitrary deadlines and class times, unmethodical assignments, restrictive regulations, and uninteresting course schema, to the fiercely passionate student, high school’s utility is nonexistent. <br/> <br/>
	Swamped with not only work which they have sought out to further their passion, but also homework from an academically rigorous course load and stripped of eight hours a day, the circumstances of a passionate youth can quickly become plightful. They are faced with the option of either impeding their passion, their social life and mental health, or their grades. While eight hours of the day dissolve into the vacuum there is no time to focus on all three. Trying to create a balancing act between grades, passion, and social/mental health is virtually impossible due to the way in which high school is structured and taught. This lack of balance arises due to a lack of time in the life of a passionate student - eight hours of mentally unstimulating school a day. What can be done though? Teachers must teach all the allotted course material to their students over the course of the school year. A better structured high school curriculum could accomplish the main teaching goals of contemporary education in a more time efficient manner. For example, at Morris Hills High School, students are made to attend 90 minute blocks in which the teachers usually present some kind of uninteresting slideshow for the first 30 minutes of class then proceeds to have some form of discussion with the class, and finally allots the rest of the class time to work on a boring exercise. At least 45 minutes from that block could be shaved down and made more useful if one throws away the uninteresting slideshow and instead comes up with the conclusions which the slideshow presents in a collaborative manner. Research has shown that students remember information they were forced to conjure up themselves more effectively therefore this change is almost a no-brainer. Another change high schools could implement would be to run classes on a semester schedule like many colleges and universities do. Currently, high school is structured in a way that almost no other real world system is structured. Four to five ninety minute classes with a lunch break half that length shoved somewhere in between for five days a week. Students stay primarily stationary in a chair for 8 hours with very little time to socialize or further their passions unrelated to school. The life of a high school student is that without freedom to stimulating work and constraint, to put it bluntly, uninteresting work. Perhaps I should be quieted and shunned into a corner for suggesting that high school’s goal should not be to teach students how to be complacent with dullness—but I suggest it nevertheless. <br/> <br/>
	The utility of the modern high school education system is obsolete for most students that have a strong passion for a field of study. High school strips a passionate student of time and energy to try and accomplish a goal which it fails to accomplish in the end. Furthermore, high school does not prepare students with a strong passion for their version of the real world. It is time that releasing passionate high school students from a penitentiary that does not suit them is normalized. 
#### Marcus Tullius Cicero and AI (trust):

Marcus Tullius Cicero was a man of many words (a thing we have in common). He was a knock-your-socks-off type orator, and let me tell you—he packed a better right hook than Mike Tyson. Naturally, then, when his adversary, Lucius Sergius Catilina, threatened to blow his head off, Cicero fired up his pen and called Catilina out on his blasphemy. “Quō ūsque tandem abūtere, Catilina, patientia nostra?” Latin for, “When, O Catilina, do you mean to cease abusing our patience.” A line so versatile it can be used to bring down dictators and ex-boyfriends all at once (hopefully, your ex-boyfriend is not a dictator). Some people prefer keying cars, some throwing hands; I prefer standing up on my high and mighty pedestal, my cafeteria table, and reciting one of the best speeches known to mankind. It was one small stroke for Cicero, but it was a massive leap for the genre of comeback literature. <br/> <br/>
I seem to have forgotten to explain the story behind Cicero’s scandalous speech. Let me amend that with a speedy dive. Cicero and Catilina were playing politics in some 63 BC, trying to beat each other for the consulship. Catilina, the trite and vindictive fellow he is, decided to bribe the other senators for a vote, but Cicero quickly caught wind. This initiated a series of highly aggressive exchanges (murder attempts) between Cicero and Catalina, eventually ending with Catalina attempting to burn down Rome after losing consulship to Cicero. Not all hope was lost, though, for Cicero may not have muscle, but he sure as hell has a lot of wits. Cicero assembled senators at the Temple of Jupiter Stator, with ever-ballsy Catilina in attendance. There, Cicero gave the First Catilinarian Oration, decimating Catilina with a flick of his tongue. <br/> <br/>
Now, I love this speech. It’s quite an exciting, exotic piece of literature. Cicero is over the top, almost obsessive; every single line delivers a punch more painful than the last. He seems as much of a perfectionist as I (nearly as crazy too). For his time, Cicero seems to be a man without fear; perhaps that’s why I admire him so much. I think our similarities would have made us great friends, a real dynamic duo roaming the streets of Rome. His work is simply exhilarating to read because he is not afraid to have a catfight. And so, it is he that I feel should be in the greatest catfight to land a spot in the history books—Cicero vs. Artificial Intelligence. 
Artificial Intelligence is obviously very good at storing and analyzing data, but surprisingly, it is also remarkably artistic. From illustrious, abstract paintings to music that speaks to the soul, AI can create art, perhaps even better than humans can. We always associate art with an expression of emotion (we humans are often powered by emotions). But to see a being with no emotion, nothing except data, creating art raises the question: does good art need emotion? <br/> <br/>
Now, this is not a death proclamation; robots are not going to eat us yet (although AI Safety is very important and should be looked into); instead, it is a battle proposition. Cicero is a wonderful orator, probably the greatest of his time, and because of this, he has no real human competition. So I propose a catfight. The location: The Colosseum (obviously). The topic: are AIs safe? Cicero takes the negative, while the AI in question takes the positive. The two obvious outcomes: nuclear death for an entire world of ungrateful humans at the hands of the AI or the production of another verbal euthanasia delivered by Cicero. Instead of spears, there will be words; instead of swords, there will be logic; instead of arrows, there will be vindictive comebacks. The faceoff might settle the question—can a creature using solely data create better art than a creature using emotion? Who knows, maybe if we find a way to bring Cicero back from the land of the beheaded, I will be atop a cafeteria table somewhere in 2093 reciting the second-greatest speech in all of history to some crank who pissed me off—the great Artificalis Orations.
