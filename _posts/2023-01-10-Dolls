Searching. I've always been searching for someone to believe in me. Tell me I'm beautiful, smark, kind, loving. Reassure me, no, validate me. I look back into the abyss like disordered array of my life and ponder if I ever believed in myself? The answer is a resounding no. Always I had my fortification in friends or faithful depression and lethargy. Now that the friends have all disintegrated before my eyes, I am left with only a hauntingly lifelike marionette manifestation of my insecurity. Someone who never has believed in my grace, smarts, or beauty. Someone whose presence evaporates what I could believe I am. How do I kill this boy doll though? Despite not believing in myself, I believe in him. I live for my belief in him, and I live for the tiny slivers of time in which he tells me his lies. How he likes me, or at least wants to fuck me? I feed off of it. I am Alisha Gupta when he believes I am, a shell when he does not. The recently disintegrated friends, left in their wake this boy doll, the only way in which Alisha Gupta can experience for at least infinitesimal times who she really is. Alisha Gupta is tired of the boy doll. She is tired of who she is with him. Tired of not believing in herself. Tired. Tired. Tired. Randomly, today I remembered my minnie mouse which was torn away from me by my father. Thrown in the basement to teach me how to sleep alone. It is time to push a pin in this poignant boy doll. The only question is how does one sleep alone?
